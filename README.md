Arduino-Pong
============

This is a first experiment made for Arduino Esplora with a 1.8" TFT screen.

I tried making a Pong game but code could and should be improved due to the fact it was my first experiment coding a game in C# with no classes or objects (I'm Actionscript developer !)

Don't hesitate to contact me to suggest some improvements and help me progress with C# !

A quick demo is available on youtube : http://youtu.be/qBdsUDIxfKk
